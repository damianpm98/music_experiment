# music_experiment
This is a C++ project where several sheet musics are given for each instrument and, as outcome, a audio file is generated accordingly.

In order to compile the project, the steps needed are the following:

```bash
cd music_experiment # Go to the music experiment folder
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Having this done, the only thing left is executing the program

```bash
./music_experiment
```
